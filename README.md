# vs-code-snippets

You can define your own snippets for specific languages. To open up a snippet file for editing, open User Snippets under File > Preferences (Code > Preferences on Mac) and select the language for which the snippets should appear.

Snippets are defined in a JSON format and stored in a per user (languageId).json file. For example, Markdown snippets go in a markdown.json file.
